# renaissBlock Content Policy

**Last Updated: [DATE]**

renaissBlock is a platform for serious creators to publish and share original work. This Content Policy explains what is and isn't allowed on our platform.

## Our Philosophy

We believe in creative freedom. We support diverse voices, perspectives, and forms of expression. We also recognize that some content can cause harm. This policy balances these considerations.

**Our approach:**
- Default to allowing content unless there's good reason not to
- Focus on clear, egregious violations rather than edge cases
- Apply policies consistently and transparently
- Provide appeals for content decisions
