## 5. Repeat Infringer Policy

renaissBlock maintains a policy of terminating accounts of repeat infringers in appropriate circumstances.

- **Third offense**: Account may be permanently terminated

### 5.2 Factors Considered

We consider:

- The nature and severity of infringement
- Whether infringement was knowing or willful
- History of the user's conduct
- Whether the user submitted false counter-notices

### 5.3 Reinstatement

Users terminated for repeat infringement generally may not create new accounts. Reinstatement is at our sole discretion.

## 6. Misrepresentation Warning

### 6.1 False Takedown Notices

Under the DMCA, anyone who knowingly makes material misrepresentations in a takedown notice may be liable for damages, including costs and attorneys' fees. Before submitting a notice, please ensure:

- You actually own or represent the copyright holder
- The use is not authorized
- The use is not fair use

### 6.2 False Counter-Notices

Similarly, material misrepresentations in counter-notices can result in liability. Only submit a counter-notice if you have a genuine, good-faith belief that the content was removed in error.

---

## 7. Fair Use

The DMCA process is not intended to suppress fair use. Fair use permits limited use of copyrighted material for purposes such as:

- Criticism and commentary
- News reporting
- Teaching and scholarship
- Parody and transformative works

If you believe removed content constitutes fair use, you may submit a counter-notification explaining your position.

## 8. Non-US Copyright Holders

While the DMCA is US law, we respect intellectual property rights globally. Copyright holders outside the US may submit notices following the same general format. We will evaluate these claims under applicable law.

---

## 9. Protecting Original Creators

renaissBlock is built for original creators. We encourage:

- Registering copyrights with appropriate authorities
- Maintaining evidence of original creation
- Using proper attribution when incorporating others' work
- Licensing content appropriately

If you discover your work being used without permission on our platform, please contact us promptly.
