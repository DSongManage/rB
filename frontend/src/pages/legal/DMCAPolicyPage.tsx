      <h2>5. Repeat Infringer Policy</h2>
      <p>
        renaissBlock maintains a policy of terminating accounts of repeat infringers in
        appropriate circumstances.
      </p>

      <h3>5.1 Strike System</h3>

        <li>History of the user's conduct</li>
        <li>Whether the user submitted false counter-notices</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Misrepresentation Warning</h2>

      <h3>6.1 False Takedown Notices</h3>
      <p>
        Under the DMCA, anyone who knowingly makes material misrepresentations in a takedown
        notice may be liable for damages, including costs and attorneys' fees. Before submitting
        a notice, please ensure:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>You actually own or represent the copyright holder</li>
        <li>The use is not authorized</li>
        <li>The use is not fair use</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>6.2 False Counter-Notices</h3>
      <p>
        Similarly, material misrepresentations in counter-notices can result in liability.
        Only submit a counter-notice if you have a genuine, good-faith belief that the content
        was removed in error.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Fair Use</h2>
      <p>
        The DMCA process is not intended to suppress fair use. Fair use permits limited use of
        copyrighted material for purposes such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Criticism and commentary</li>
        <li>News reporting</li>
        <li>Teaching and scholarship</li>
        <li>Parody and transformative works</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you believe removed content constitutes fair use, you may submit a counter-notification
        explaining your position.
      </p>
