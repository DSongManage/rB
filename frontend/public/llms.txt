## What is renaissBlock?

renaissBlock is a comic collaboration platform where writers and artists create together with automatic, trustless revenue sharing. Writers who can't draw find artists. Artists who want original projects find writers. They agree on a revenue split, publish chapter by chapter, and every sale automatically distributes earnings to each collaborator's wallet.
